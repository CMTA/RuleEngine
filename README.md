# RuleEngine

This repository includes the RuleEngine contracts for [CMTAT](https://github.com/CMTA/CMTAT) and [ERC-3643](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3643) tokens.

The RuleEngine is an external contract used to apply transfer restrictions to another contract, such as CMTAT and ERC-3643 tokens. Acting as a controller, it can call different contract rules and apply these rules on each transfer.

## Contract Variants

Two deployable contracts are available, differing in their access control mechanism:

| Contract | Access Control | Interface | Use Case |
|----------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| `RuleEngine` | Role-Based (AccessControl) | RBAC roles | Multi-operator environments with granular permissions |
| `RuleEngineOwnable` | ERC-173 Ownership | `Ownable` | Single-owner setups, simpler administration |

ERC-3643 compliance specification indicates the use of ERC-173.

> The standard relies on ERC-173 to define contract ownership, with the owner having the responsibility of setting the Compliance parameters and binding the Compliance to a Token contract.

Both contracts share the same core functionality through `RuleEngineBase` and support:

- ERC-1404 transfer restrictions
- ERC-3643 compliance interface
- ERC-2771 meta-transactions (gasless)
- Multiple token bindings

[TOC]

## Motivation

- Why use a dedicated contract with rules instead of implementing it directly in CMTAT or [ERC-3643](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3643) tokens?

There are several reasons to do this:

- Flexibility: These different features are not standard and common to all tokens. From an implementation perspective, using a rule engine with custom rules allows for each issuer or contract user to decide which rules to apply.

- Code efficiency: The CMTAT token (and generally also all ERC-3643 tokens) is currently "heavy," meaning its contract code size is close to the maximum limit. This makes it challenging to add new features directly inside the token contract.

- Reusability: 

  - The RuleEngine can be used inside other contracts besides CMTAT. For instance, the RuleEngine has been used in [our contract to distribute dividends](https://www.taurushq.com/blog/equity-tokenization-how-to-pay-dividend-on-chain-using-cmtat/). 

  - A same deployed `RuleEngine` can also be used with several different tokens if the rules allow it, which is the case for all read-only rules.

Why use this `RuleEngine` contract instead of setting the `rule` directly in the token contract?

- Using a RuleEngine allows to call several different rules. For example, a blacklist rule to allow the issuer to manage its own list of blacklisted addresses and a sanctionlist rule to use the [Chainalysis oracle for sanctions screening](https://go.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-oracle-docs.html) to forbid transfers from addresses listed in sanctions designations published by organizations such as the US, EU, or UN.

When may the use of `RuleEngine` not be appropriate?

- If you plan to call only one rule (e.g a whitelist rule), it could make sense to directly set the rule in the token contract instead of using a RuleEngine. This will simplify configuration and reduce runtime gas costs.

## How it works

This diagram illustrates how a transfer with a CMTAT or ERC-3643 token with a RuleEngine works:

![RuleEngine.drawio](./doc/schema/RuleEngine.drawio.png)

 

1. The token holders initiate a transfer transaction on the token contract.
2. The transfer function inside the token calls the ERC-3643 function `transferred` from the RuleEngine with the following parameters inside: `from, to, value`.
3. The Rule Engine calls each rule separately. If the transfer is not authorized by the rule, the rule must directly revert (no return value).

> **Warning:** The RuleEngine iterates over all configured rules on every transfer (and on every call to `detectTransferRestriction`, `canTransfer`, etc.). Adding a large number of rules increases gas consumption for each transfer and may eventually exceed the block gas limit, effectively preventing any transfer from succeeding. Administrators should keep the rule set small and be mindful that a misconfigured or gas-heavy rule can also impact all transfers.

### How to set it

#### Compatibility

| RuleEngine version                                           | Compatible Versions                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **v3.0.0-rc1**                                               | CMTAT ≥ v3.0.0<br />CMTAT target version: [v3.2.0-rc2](https://github.com/CMTA/CMTAT/releases/tag/v3.2.0-rc2) |
| **v3.0.0-rc0**                                               | CMTAT ≥ v3.0.0<br />                                         |
| **[v1.0.2.1](https://github.com/CMTA/RuleEngine/releases/tag/v1.0.2.1)** | CMTAT v2.3.0 (audited)                                       |

#### CMTAT v3.0.0

CMTAT provides the following function to set a RuleEngine inside a CMTAT token:

```solidity
setRuleEngine(IRuleEngine ruleEngine_) 
```

This function is defined in the extension module `ValidationModuleRuleEngine`

#### ERC-3643 token

[ERC-3643](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3643) defined the following function in the standard interface to set a compliance contract

```solidity
setCompliance(address _compliance)
```



## How to include it

While the RuleEngine has been designed for CMTAT and ERC-3643 tokens, it can be used with other contracts to apply transfer restrictions.

For that, the only thing to do is to import in your contract the interface `IRuleEngine`(CMTAT) or `IERC3643Compliance` (ERC-3643), which declares the corresponding functions to call by the token contract. This interface can be found [here](https://github.com/CMTA/CMTAT/blob/23a1e59f913d079d0c09d32fafbd95ab2d426093/contracts/interfaces/engine/IRuleEngine.sol).

### Like CMTAT

Before each ERC-20 transfer, the CMTAT calls the function `transferred` which is the entrypoint for the RuleEngine.

```solidity
function transferred(address from,address to,uint256 value)
```

If you want to apply restrictions on the spender address, you have to call the `transferred` function which takes the spender argument in your ERC-20  function `transferFrom`.

```solidity
function transferred(address spender,address from,address to,uint256 value)
```

For example, CMTAT defines the interaction with the RuleEngine inside a specific module, [ValidationModuleRuleEngine](https://github.com/CMTA/CMTAT/blob/master/contracts/modules/wrapper/extensions/ValidationModule/ValidationModuleRuleEngine.sol) and [CMTATBaseRuleEngine](https://github.com/CMTA/CMTAT/blob/master/contracts/modules/1_CMTATBaseRuleEngine.sol).

- ValidationModuleRuleEngine

![transferred](./doc/other/CMTAT/transferred.png)

- CMTATBaseRuleEngine

![checkTransferred](./doc/other/CMTAT/checkTransferred.png)

This function `_transferred` is called before each transfer/burn/mint through the internal function `_checkTransferred` defined in [CMTAT_BASE](https://github.com/CMTA/CMTAT/blob/23a1e59f913d079d0c09d32fafbd95ab2d426093/contracts/modules/CMTAT_BASE.sol#L198).

### Like ERC-3643

The ERC-3643 defines several functions used as entrypoints for an ERC-3643 token.

As for CMTAT, the main entrypoint is `transferred` which must be called for each ERC-20 transfer.

Contrary to CMTAT, ERC-3643 does not apply restriction on the spender address (`transferFrom`).

They are the following:

```solidity
// read-only function
function canTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 value) external view returns (bool);
// ERC-20 transfer
function transferred(address from, address to, uint256 value) external;
// mint
function created(address to, uint256 value) external;
// burn
function destroyed(address from, uint256 value) external;
```

## Interface

### CMTAT

The `RuleEngine` base interface is defined in the CMTAT repository.

![cmtat_surya_inheritance_IRuleEngine.sol](./doc/schema/cmtat_surya_inheritance_IRuleEngine.sol.png)

It inherits from several others interfaces: `IERC1404Extend`, `IERC7551Compliance`, `IERC3643ComplianceContract`

```solidity
// IRuleEngine
function transferred(address spender, address from, address to, uint256 value) 
external;

// IERC-1404
function detectTransferRestriction(address from,address to,uint256 value) 
external view returns (uint8);

function messageForTransferRestriction(uint8 restrictionCode) 
external view returns (string memory);
    
// IERC-1404Extend    
enum REJECTED_CODE_BASE {
        TRANSFER_OK,
        TRANSFER_REJECTED_DEACTIVATED,
        TRANSFER_REJECTED_PAUSED,
        TRANSFER_REJECTED_FROM_FROZEN,
        TRANSFER_REJECTED_TO_FROZEN,
        TRANSFER_REJECTED_SPENDER_FROZEN,
        TRANSFER_REJECTED_FROM_INSUFFICIENT_ACTIVE_BALANCE
    }

function detectTransferRestrictionFrom(address spender,address from,address to,uint256 value) 
external view returns (uint8);
   
 
// IERC7551Compliance
function canTransferFrom(address spender,address from,address to,uint256 value)
external view returns (bool);


// IER3643ComplianceRead
function canTransfer(address from,address to,uint256 value) 
external view returns (bool isValid);

// IERC3643IComplianceContract
function transferred(address from, address to, uint256 value) 
external;
```



### ERC-3643

The [ERC-3643](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3643) compliance interface is defined in [IERC3643Compliance.sol](src/interfaces/IERC3643Compliance.sol).

A specific module implements this interface for the RuleEngine: [ERC3643Compliance.sol](src/modules/ERC3643Compliance.sol)

![ERC3643ComplianceModuleUML](./doc/schema/vscode-uml/ERC3643ComplianceModuleUML.png)

## Technical

### Dependencies

The toolchain includes the following components, where the versions are the latest ones that we tested:

- Foundry (forge-std) [v1.14.0](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/releases/tag/v1.10.0)
- Solidity [0.8.33](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.33/)
- OpenZeppelin Contracts (submodule) [v5.5.0](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v5.5.0)
- CMTAT [v3.2.0-rc2](https://github.com/CMTA/CMTAT/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc7)

### Access Control

Two access control mechanisms are available depending on which contract you deploy:

#### RuleEngine (RBAC - AccessControl)

The `RuleEngine` contract uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) via OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl`.

Each module defines the roles useful to restrict its functions. The contract overrides the OpenZeppelin function `hasRole` to give by default all the roles to the `admin`.

See also [docs.openzeppelin.com - AccessControl](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/access#AccessControl)

#### RuleEngineOwnable (ERC-173 Ownership)

The `RuleEngineOwnable` contract uses [ERC-173](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-173) ownership via OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`.

All protected functions require the caller to be the contract owner. The owner can:
- Transfer ownership to another address via `transferOwnership(address)`
- Renounce ownership via `renounceOwnership()` (makes the contract ownerless)

This is a simpler access control model suitable for single-owner deployments.

See also [docs.openzeppelin.com - Ownable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/access#Ownable)

#### Role list (RuleEngine only)

Here is the list of roles and their 32 bytes identifier for the `RuleEngine` contract.

The default admin is the address put in argument (`admin`) inside the constructor.

It is set in the constructor when the contract is deployed.

> Note: For `RuleEngineOwnable`, all protected functions are controlled by the single `owner` address instead of roles.

#### Role by modules (RuleEngine)

Here is a summary table for each restricted function defined in a module.
For function signatures, struct arguments are represented with their corresponding native type.

> Note: For `RuleEngineOwnable`, replace the role requirement with `onlyOwner` for all protected functions.

### UML

Here is the UML of the main contracts:

#### RuleEngine
![RuleEngineUML](./doc/schema/vscode-uml/RuleEngineUML.png)

#### RuleEngineOwnable

`RuleEngineOwnable` shares the same base functionality as `RuleEngine` but uses ERC-173 ownership instead of RBAC.

```
RuleEngineOwnable
├── ERC2771ModuleStandalone (gasless support)
├── RuleEngineBase (core functionality)
│   ├── VersionModule
│   ├── RulesManagementModule
│   ├── ERC3643ComplianceModule
│   └── IRuleEngineERC1404
└── Ownable (ERC-173 access control)
```

**Key differences from RuleEngine:**
- Constructor takes `owner_` instead of `admin`
- All protected functions use `onlyOwner` modifier
- Supports `transferOwnership()` and `renounceOwnership()`
- Implements ERC-173 interface (`supportsInterface(0x7f5828d0)` returns `true`)





### Graph

Here is the surya graph of the main contract:

![surya_graph_RuleEngine](./doc/schema/surya/surya_graph/surya_graph_RuleEngine.sol.png)

## Functionality

Several functionalities are not implemented because it makes more sense to directly implement them in the token smart contract

The RuleEngine can be removed from the main token contract by calling these dedicated functions

- CMTAT v3.0.0: `setRuleEngine(address ruleEngine)`
- ERC-3643 token: `setCompliance(address _compliance)`

### Available Rules

Rules have their own dedicated repository: [github.com/CMTA/Rules](https://github.com/CMTA/Rules)

The following rules are available:

| Rule                    | Type<br />[read-only / read-write] | Audit planned                     | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| RuleWhitelist           | Read-only                           | &#x2611;                          | This rule can be used to restrict transfers from/to only addresses inside a whitelist. |
| RuleWhitelistWrapper    | Read-only                           | &#x2611;                          | This rule can be used to restrict transfers from/to only addresses inside a group of whitelist rules managed by different operators. |
| RuleBlacklist           | Read-only                           | &#x2611;                          | This rule can be used to forbid transfer from/to addresses in the blacklist |
| RuleSanctionList        | Read-only                           | &#x2611;                          | The purpose of this contract is to use the oracle contract from Chainalysis to forbid transfer from/to an address  included in a sanctions designation (US, EU, or UN). |
| RuleConditionalTransfer | Read-Write                          | &#x2612;<br />(experimental rule) | This rule requires that transfers have to be approved before being executed by the token holders. |



### Gasless support (ERC-2771)

![ERC2771ModuleUML](./doc/schema/vscode-uml/ERC2771ModuleUML.png)

The RuleEngine supports client-side gasless transactions using the standard [ERC-2771](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2771).

The contract uses the OpenZeppelin contract `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable`, which allows a contract to get the original client with `_msgSender()` instead of the feepayer given by `msg.sender`.

At deployment, the parameter  `forwarder` inside the RuleEngine contract constructor has to be set  with the defined address of the forwarder. 

After deployment, the forwarder is immutable and can not be changed.

References:

- [OpenZeppelin Meta Transactions](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/metatx)

- OpenGSN has deployed several forwarders, see their [documentation](https://docs.opengsn.org/contracts/#receiving-a-relayed-call) for examples.

### Upgradeable

A proxy architecture (upgradeable) increases the code complexity as well as the runtime gas cost for each transaction. This is why the RuleEngine is not upgradeable.

Moreover, in a proxy architecture, each new implementation must be compatible (storage) with the precedent implementation, which can reduce the ability to improve the code.

In case you use the same RuleEngine for several different tokens, unfortunately, you will have to update the address of the RuleEngine set in each token contract separately. 

### Urgency mechanism

#### Pause

There are no functionalities to put the RuleEngine in pause . 

The RuleEngine can be removed from the main token contract by calling the dedicated functions to manage the RuleEngine

#### Kill / Deactivate the contracts

There are no functionalities to kill/deactivate the contracts.

Similar to the pause functionality, the RuleEngine can be directly removed from the main token contract.

```

Returns the full list of currently configured rules.

This is a view-only function and does not modify state.

This operation will copy the entire storage to memory, which can be quite expensive. 

This is designed to mostly be used by view accessors that are queried without any gas fees.

**Return Values:**

| Type      | Description                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| address[] | An array containing all active rule contract addresses. |



------

##### clearRules() 

```solidity
function clearRules() 
public virtual override(IRulesManagementModule) 
onlyRole(RULES_MANAGEMENT_ROLE)
```

Removes all configured rules.

After calling this function, no rules will remain set.

Developers should keep in mind that this function has an unbounded cost and using it may render the function uncallable if the set grows to the point where clearing it consumes too much gas to fit in a block.

------

##### addRule(address rule_) 

```solidity
function addRule(IRule rule_) 
public virtual override(IRulesManagementModule) 
onlyRole(RULES_MANAGEMENT_ROLE)
```

Adds a new rule to the current rule set.

Reverts if the rule address is zero or already exists in the set.

**Input Parameters:**

| Name  | Type  | Description                |
| ----- | ----- | -------------------------- |
| rule_ | IRule | The IRule contract to add. |



------

##### removeRule(address rule_)

```solidity
 function removeRule(IRule rule_) 
 public virtual 
 override(IRulesManagementModule) 
 onlyRole(RULES_MANAGEMENT_ROLE)
```

Removes a specific rule from the current rule set.

Reverts if the provided rule is not found or does not match the stored rule at its index.

**Input Parameters:**

| Name  | Type  | Description                   |
| ----- | ----- | ----------------------------- |
| rule_ | IRule | The IRule contract to remove. |



------

##### containsRule(address rule_) -> bool

```solidity
function containsRule(IRule rule_) 
public view virtual override(IRulesManagementModule) 
returns (bool)
```

Checks whether a specific rule is currently configured.

**Input Parameters:**

| Name  | Type  | Description                                 |
| ----- | ----- | ------------------------------------------- |
| rule_ | IRule | The IRule contract to check for membership. |



**Return Values:**

| Type | Description                                   |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- |
| bool | True if the rule is present, false otherwise. |

## Toolchains and Usage

*Explain how it works.*

### Configuration

Here are the settings for [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) and [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh).

- `hardhat.config.js`
  - Solidity [v0.8.33](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.33/)
  - EVM version: Prague (Pectra upgrade)
  - Optimizer: true, 200 runs

- `foundry.toml`
  - Solidity [v0.8.33](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.33/)
  - EVM version: Prague (Pectra upgrade)
  - Optimizer: true, 200 runs




### Toolchain installation
The contracts are developed and tested with [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh), a smart contract development toolchain.

To install the Foundry suite, please refer to the official instructions in the [Foundry book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

### Initialization

You must first initialize the submodules, with

```
forge install
```

See also the command's [documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-install).

Later you can update all the submodules with:

```
forge update
```

See also the command's [documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-update).

### Compilation

The official documentation is available in the Foundry [website](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/build-commands)

```bash
# Build all contracts
forge build

# Build specific contract
forge build --contracts src/RuleEngine.sol
forge build --contracts src/RuleEngineOwnable.sol
```
### Contract size

```bash
forge build --sizes
```

Both `RuleEngine` and `RuleEngineOwnable` have similar bytecode sizes since they share the same base functionality. The `RuleEngineOwnable` contract is slightly smaller as `Ownable` has less overhead than `AccessControl`.



![contract-size](./doc/compilation/contract-size.png)

### Testing

You can run the tests with

```bash
forge test
```

To run a specific test, use

```bash
forge test --match-contract <contract name> --match-test <function name>
```

Generate gas report

```bash
forge test --gas-report
```

See also the test framework's [official documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/tests), and that of the [test commands](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/test-commands).

### Coverage

A code coverage is available in [index.html](./doc/coverage/coverage/index.html).

![code-coverage](./doc/coverage/code-coverage.png)

* Perform a code coverage
```
forge coverage
```

* Generate LCOV report
```
forge coverage --report lcov
```

- Generate `index.html`

```bash
forge coverage --no-match-coverage "(script|mocks|test)" --report lcov && genhtml lcov.info --branch-coverage --output-dir coverage
```

See [Solidity Coverage in VS Code with Foundry](https://mirror.xyz/devanon.eth/RrDvKPnlD-pmpuW7hQeR5wWdVjklrpOgPCOA-PJkWFU) & [Foundry forge coverage](https://www.rareskills.io/post/foundry-forge-coverage)

### Deployment
The official documentation is available in the Foundry [website](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/deploying)

#### Choosing a Contract

| Scenario | Recommended Contract |
|----------|---------------------|
| Multiple operators with different permissions | `RuleEngine` |
| Single administrator | `RuleEngineOwnable` |
| Integration with existing RBAC systems | `RuleEngine` |
| Simpler deployment and management | `RuleEngineOwnable` |

#### Script

> This documentation has been written for the version v1.0.2

To run the script for deployment, you need to create a .env file. The value for CMTAT_ADDRESS is required only to use the script **RuleEngine.s.sol**

Warning: putting your private key in a .env file is not the most secure approach.

* File .env
```
PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
CMTAT_ADDRESS=<CMTAT_ADDRESS>
```
* Command

CMTAT with RuleEngine

```bash
forge script script/CMTATWithRuleEngineScript.s.sol:CMTATWithRuleEngineScript --rpc-url=$RPC_URL  --broadcast --verify -vvv
```


- Value of YOUR_RPC_URL with a local instance of anvil : [127.0.0.1:8545](http://127.0.0.1:8545)

```bash
forge script script/CMTATWithRuleEngineScript.s.sol:CMTATWithRuleEngineScript --rpc-url=127.0.0.1:8545  --broadcast --verify -vvv
```

Only RuleEngine with a Whitelist contract

```bash
forge script script/RuleEngineScript.s.sol:RuleEngineScript --rpc-url=$RPC_URL  --broadcast --verify -vvv
```

- With anvil

```bash
forge script script/RuleEngineScript.s.sol:RuleEngineScript --rpc-url=127.0.0.1:8545  --broadcast --verify -vvv
```

### Solidity style guideline

RuleEngine follows the [solidity style guideline](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html) and the [natspec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/natspec-format.html) for comments

#### Formatting & Linting

We use Foundry's built-in formatter and linter:

```bash
# Format all Solidity files
forge fmt

# Check formatting without modifying files
forge fmt --check

# Run the Solidity linter
forge lint
```

- Orders of Functions

Functions are grouped according to their visibility and ordered:

```
1. constructor

2. receive function (if exists)

3. fallback function (if exists)

4. external

5. public

6. internal

7. private
```

Within a grouping, place the `view` and `pure` functions last

- Function declaration

```
1. Visibility
2. Mutability
3. Virtual
4. Override
5. Custom modifiers
```
